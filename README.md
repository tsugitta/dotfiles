## tsugitta's dotfiles

To just record my dotfiles for me. The particular dotfile, such as `.zshrc`, assumes that `powerline` or `rbenv` and so on are already installed; so these dotfiles cannot be used perfectly by itself.

### Copying dotfiles

```bash
$ cd
$ git clone git@github.com:tsugitta/dotfiles.git
$ cd dotfiles
$ ./install.sh
```

Create backup before execute the above commands.
